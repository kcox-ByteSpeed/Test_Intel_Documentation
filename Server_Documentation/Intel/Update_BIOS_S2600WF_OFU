# Intel® Server Board S2600WF Family BIOS and Firmware Update via Intel® One Boot Flash Update (Intel® OFU) Utility

***

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the update, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Firmware Requirements:
    - System BIOS: R02010016 or later
    - ME Firmware: 04.01.04.804 or later
    - BMC Firmware: 2.88.71773d70 or later
    - FRUSDR: 2.04 or later
    - PMEM: 01.02.00.5446 or later


2. Intel® One Boot Flash Update (Intel® OFU) Utility Version: V14.1 Build 31 or later.

3. Supported Operating Systems:
    - Windows* 
    - Linux*

4. Important Notes:
    - The OFU utility with the flashupdt tool does not support PMEM firmware updates. Please refer to the "PMEM_Update_Instructions.txt" in the package for specific instructions.
    - Ensure that no BIOS admin passwords are set, or prepare to include password parameters during the update process.

## Update Instructions
1. Preparation:
    - Download and extract the update package to a directory on your system.
    - Review the included ReleaseNotes.txt for specific details on updates, bug fixes, and known issues.

2. Update Process:
    - Windows:
        - Open a command prompt or PowerShell in the directory where the package is extracted.
        - Execute the startup.bat script to begin the update process. The OFU utility will handle the sequence: ME, BIOS, FD, FRUSDR, BMC, and PMEM (if applicable).
        - The system will automatically reset after the updates are applied.

    - Linux:
        - Open a terminal in the directory where the package is extracted.
        - Execute the startup.sh script using the command sh startup.sh. The OFU utility will uninstall any existing OFU versions, install the latest one, and proceed with the update sequence: - ME, BIOS, FD, FRUSDR, BMC, and PMEM (if applicable).
        - The system will automatically reset after the updates are applied.

3. Post-Update:
    - Verify the firmware versions post-update to ensure that all components have been successfully updated to the required versions.
    - If issues are encountered, refer to the troubleshooting section in the ReleaseNotes.txt.

***

## Remarks
- File Case Sensitivity: The Intel® OFU utility is case-sensitive. If transferring the update package between different environments, ensure files are properly extracted or mounted to avoid case conversion issues.
- Security Considerations: Starting from BMC version 2.88, SSL certificates must be 2048-bit or longer, and BMC credential access is required for files in internal virtual media.
- Firmware Downgrade Limitations: Some firmware components, such as BMC and FRUSDR, cannot be downgraded to previous versions.
